Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.Metazoans are a multicellular organism, with different groups of cells serving different functions. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. === Arthropod anatomy ===

Arthropods comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species.Insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures. Comparative anatomy relates to the comparison of anatomical structures (both gross and microscopic) in different animals. Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. The Hellenistic Egyptian city of Alexandria was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states. Some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria. Herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine. Herophilus's knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and nervous system, and characterizing the course of disease. He was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body. Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart, including the tricuspid. It was Herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis. Great feats were made during the third century BCE in both the digestive and reproductive systems. He showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes. Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection. Praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins. He compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals. He was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals. Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years. === Medieval to early modern ===
Anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century; as the historian Marie Boas writes, "Progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid". : 120–121  Between 1275 and 1326, the anatomists Mondino de Luzzi, Alessandro Achillini and Antonio Benivieni at Bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times. It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the abdomen, then the thorax, then the head and limbs. Originally from Brabant, Vesalius published the influential book De humani corporis fabrica ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543. === Late modern ===

In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century. A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadavers. Some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of "pre-clinical" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools. Medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching. Ignaz Semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Before the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. == See also ==

RESPONSE:
Hello! How can I assist you today with information on arthropod anatomy and comparative anatomy?

User:  Hi! I would like to know more about the evolution of anatomy and its understanding over time, from classical times to modern era.

Assistant:  Certainly! The study of anatomy has a rich history, with significant advancements made over the centuries. Here's an overview of the evolution of anatomy from classical times to the modern era:

Classical Times (Before 5th Century CE):

* Ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans made significant contributions to the field of anatomy.
* Greek physicians such as Galen and Hippocrates studied animal anatomy and performed dissections to gain knowledge of the human body.
* The Egyptians developed a detailed understanding of the human body and its organs, including the heart and liver.

Medieval to Early Modern Period (5th Century CE to 16th Century CE):

* The study of anatomy slowed down significantly during this period, with little progress made until the 16th century.
* In the 13th century, Mondino de Luzzi, Alessandro Achillini, and Antonio Benivieni at the University of Bologna performed the first systematic human dissections since ancient times.
* In 1543, Andreas Vesalius published the influential book "De humani corporis fabrica" ("the structure of the human body"), which described the body in detail and challenged Galen's theories.

Late Modern Period (16th Century CE to 19th Century CE):

* The invention of the microscope and the development of cell theory in the 17th century led to a greater understanding of the structure and function of cells and tissues.
* In the 18th and 19th centuries, the study of anatomy became more systematic and scientific, with the establishment of medical schools and the development of techniques such as dissection and histology.

Modern Era (20th Century CE to Present):

* The 20th century saw significant advances in the field of anatomy, with the development of new techniques such as radiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
* The discovery of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them.
* Today, the study of anatomy continues to evolve with advances in technology and new discoveries about the human body.
