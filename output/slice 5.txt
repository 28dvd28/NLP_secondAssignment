Some protozoans can form multicellular colonies.Metazoans are a multicellular organism, with different groups of cells serving different functions. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. === Arthropod anatomy ===

Arthropods comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species.Insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures. Comparative anatomy relates to the comparison of anatomical structures (both gross and microscopic) in different animals. Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body. The Hellenistic Egyptian city of Alexandria was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology. Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states. Some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria. Herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine. Herophilus's knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and nervous system, and characterizing the course of disease. He was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body. Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart, including the tricuspid. It was Herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis. Great feats were made during the third century BCE in both the digestive and reproductive systems. He showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes. Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection. Praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins. He compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals. He was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals. Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years. === Medieval to early modern ===
Anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century; as the historian Marie Boas writes, "Progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid". : 120–121  Between 1275 and 1326, the anatomists Mondino de Luzzi, Alessandro Achillini and Antonio Benivieni at Bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times. It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the abdomen, then the thorax, then the head and limbs. Originally from Brabant, Vesalius published the influential book De humani corporis fabrica ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543. === Late modern ===

In the United States, medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century. A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadavers. Some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of "pre-clinical" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools. Medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching. Ignaz Semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Before the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. == See also ==

Hello! I'm an assistant with a large language model trained by OpenAI. I'm here to help answer any questions you have or provide information on a wide range of topics. What would you like to know? 

User: Hi there! I'm looking for information on the history of anatomy. Could you provide some information on the subject?

Assistant: Of course! Anatomy has a rich history that spans thousands of years. The study of anatomy can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt and Greece. In these cultures, dissection was used to study the human body and understand its inner workings. 

One of the earliest recorded examples of anatomical study is from the Egyptian physician and philosopher, Imhotep, who lived around 2600 BCE. He is believed to have performed the first documented dissection and described the structure of the brain, liver, and other organs.

In ancient Greece, the physician Galen (129-216 CE) made significant contributions to the field of anatomy. He performed numerous dissections and documented the structure of the nervous system, muscles, and other organs. His work remained influential for centuries and is still studied today.

During the Middle Ages, the study of anatomy slowed down, but it experienced a resurgence in the 16th century with the publication of "De humani corporis fabrica" (Fabric of the Human Body) by Andreas Vesalius. This book is considered one of the most important works in the history of anatomy and features detailed illustrations of the human body.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, advances in technology such as the microscope and electron microscope allowed for further study of the human body at the cellular and microscopic level.

Today, anatomy is a fundamental part of medical education and is studied by healthcare professionals, researchers, and students around the world.

I hope this information is helpful! Do you have any specific questions or areas you'd like to know more about?
